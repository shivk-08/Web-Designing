      <b>U.S. sounds alarm over hackers targeting Cisco security devices</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The affected equipment included a subset of Cisco Adaptive Security
      Appliance (ASA) 5500-x Series devices, which work as firewalls protecting
      corporate netwoeks from hackers.

      The U.S.government's cyber defence agency has issued urgent guidance to
      other federal agencies over hackers exploiting a previously unknown
      vulnerability in Cisco security devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an emergency directive issued Thursday, the Cybersecurity and
      Infrastructure Security Agency said government cyber workers had just over
      one day to account for all such devices plugged into their networks, scan
      them for malicious activity, and apply relevant software updates intended
      to patch the vulnerability.

      This widespread campaign poses asignificant risk to victims' networks,

      corporate networks from hackers.

      Although network edge devices like firewalls are meant to provide
      additional security, their exposure to the wider internet and the frequent
      failure to keep their software curent can make them tempting targets.
      Verizon's annual report on digital breaches, published in May, said the
      exploitation of edge devices had surged in 2024.

      In a blog post also published Thursday, Cisco said the malicious activity
      aimed at its equipment was complex and sophisticated. It tied the hackers
      involved to a previously discovered cyberespionage nicknamed ArcaneDoor,
      which researchers at internet intelligence firm Censys have in turn tied
      to China. Beijing routinely denies being behind such hacking campaigns.

      Cisco said it urged customers to follow its provided guidance to determine
      "exposure and courses of action."
